# Justification
Covid-19 has become a global pandemic as recorded by the WHO in March 2020. Since the disease can be
transmitted between humans, it has become a very difficult disease to contain. To be able to effectively
contain the disease, people are expected to adhere to the common prevention procedures and most
importantly, people must be tested to prevent any severe occurrences of the disease. So far, The RT-PCR
techniques is widely used for the testing of covid-19 however due to the rapid spread of the disease, there
is limited resources to enable testing of entire populations using the RT-PCR procedure. The RT-PCR
technique has also in some instances proven to give false-negatives therefore more reliable techniques
need to be developed.
Since different features observed from an X-ray image may represent the existence of various diseases,
even the most experienced radiologists may not be able to accurately make a diagnosis from the images.
This therefore means that sophisticated detection models need to be employed to ensure proper
diagnosis of covid-19 pneumonia. This research is critical since it will reduce misdiagnosis of covid-19 and
in the process will ensure that the disease is detected early and treated efficiently.
# Research questions
• What is the effect on accuracy of incorporating patient medical history in denseNet CNN model
detection of covid-19 pneumonia from chest X-ray images?
• How do we incorporate patient history in CNN detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray
images?
# Research Objectives
• To assess the effect of historical medical data on the accuracy of CNN detection of pneumonia
from X-ray images
• To determine which method to use with regards to incorporate patient medical history in CNN
detection
# Scope of the study
The study seeks to improve on the accuracy levels of pneumonia using NIH chest X-rays image dataset.
Data on medical history for the different x-ray images are to be used in the study. The project will only
focus on image features used for the detection of pneumonia and not any other disease.
# Assumptions
For improved CNN modeling of pneumonia detection, one of the main assumptions made is that there is
available medical data on the different x-ray images available. It is also assumed that image features
showing the existence of pneumonia are universal and not specific to given type of people or people of a
specific geographical area.
